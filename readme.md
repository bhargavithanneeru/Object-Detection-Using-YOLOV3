# Object Detection with YOLOv3

## Overview
This project implements object detection using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3), a real-time object detection system known for its speed and accuracy. YOLOv3 is capable of detecting objects in images and videos with high efficiency, making it suitable for various computer vision applications.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.7.17
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow 1.15
- Keras 2.2.4
- Numpy

## Pre-trained Weights Installation and Conversion
1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   This project relies on OpenCV and TensorFlow.
3. **Pre-trained Weights**: Downloaded pre-trained weights for the YOLOv3 model. These weights are necessary for the YOLOv3 model to perform object detection.

4. **Conversion to Keras Model**: Converted the Darknet YOLO model to a Keras model, This conversion is necessary to use the YOLOv3 model with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Architecture
The architecture of the system involves input data from the webcam, the trained YOLOv3 model, and output displayed on the screen. The webcam captures input images, which are processed by the YOLOv3 model for object detection. The detected objects are then labeled and their accuracy scores are calculated before being displayed on the screen.
